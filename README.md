Knowledge Base for Quiet Lounge
--------------------------------

## How To:
To get things added to our Knowledge Base please make a pull request formatted in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

Please make sure you fork the repo and make a pull request to the main repo to submit documentation. 

Documentation's base path is `/docs/` and only Quiet Lounge staff can make documents in this root folder. All user-submitted documents must go into subfolders relevant to the pack or the topic they are for.

## Formatting:
Pull requests will only be accepted using GitHub flavored Markdown with the file extension ending in .md.
Please make sure you include images as examples whenever possible.
